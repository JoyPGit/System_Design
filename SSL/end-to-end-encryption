end-to-end encryption

In true end-to-end encryption, encryption occurs at the device level. That is, messages and files are encrypted before they leave the phone or computer and isn’t decrypted until it reaches its destination.

The end-to-end encrypted system provides each with a public-private key pair, whereby their public keys are stored on the server and their private keys are stored on their device.
 
The security behind end-to-end encryption is enabled by the creation of a public-private key pair. This process, also known as asymmetric cryptography, employs separate cryptographic keys for securing and decrypting the message. Public keys are widely disseminated and are used to lock or encrypt a message. Private keys are only known by the owner and are used to unlock or decrypt the message.

Alice wants to send Bob an encrypted message. She uses Bob’s public key to encrypt her message to him. Then, when Bob receives the message, he uses his private key on his device to decrypt the message from Alice.

Bad guys will attack the weakest parts of your system because they are the parts most likely to be easily broken. Given that data is most vulnerable when stored on a server, hackers’ techniques are focused on gaining access to servers.

But, attacking the data while encrypted is just too much work [for attackers].  

Services like Gmail, Yahoo or Microsoft enable the provider to access the content of users’ data on its servers because these providers hold copies to the decryption keys. As such, these providers can read users’ email and files. In Google’s case, its possession of decryption keys has enabled them in the past to provide the Google account holder with targeted ads.
