     * A Decorator Pattern says that just "attach a flexible additional responsibilities 
     * to an object dynamically".
     * 
     * In other words, The Decorator Pattern uses composition instead of inheritance to 
     * extend the functionality of an object at runtime.
     * 
     * 
     * It is used:
     * When you want to transparently and dynamically add responsibilities to objects 
     * without affecting other objects.
     * 
     * When you want to add responsibilities to an object that you may want to change in future.
     * 
     * imp : Instead of changing method, use an interface and implement it
     * 
     * MVC SpringBoot? is controller an interface?
